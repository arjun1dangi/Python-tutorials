print('''I don’t know where I belong
but I know I don’t belong here.

I don’t know much
but I know what is right.

I don’t have much
but I have myself.

I’m not a man yet
but I’m not a child.

I don’t want much
but I want more than this.

I don’t belong to Mather,
I belong to God.

My mother told me
never to forget.''')
